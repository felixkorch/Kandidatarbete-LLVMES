#+TITLE: Guide on testing

** Assemble test programs

#+COMMENT: Add link to reference card of assembler syntax

This project ships with an assembler, ~asm6502.lua~, which can be used to
produce binaries from your test program(s). To use the included assembler your
program needs to be written in our flavor of 6502. Valid programs follow this
syntax and has the extension ~.lst~.

Place your test files in ~list-sources/~ and run =python3 autobuild -t lua= OR =python3 autobuild -t luajit= from the
root of this project. This will produce binary files for all of your source
files included in ~list-sources~ and place them in ~list-bins~, creating the
output folder if necessary.

See Syntax.md for a full description of syntax for asm6502.lua
